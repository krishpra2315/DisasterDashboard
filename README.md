# DisasterDashboard

This project uses a [storms.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christinezinkand/storms) file from kaggle and multiple APIs to create an interactive data visualization of multiple tropical storms and hurricanes with recent news and accurate information about these disasters and their impact

APIs include [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev) for hurricane impact summaries, [Currents](https://currentsapi.services/en) for recent news, and [Open Layers](https://openlayers.org/) for developing the interactive map features
